🚀 Excited to share my latest project: A Complete OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) System!

Built a robust solution that automatically evaluates and scores answer sheets using computer vision and image processing techniques.

✨ **Key Features:**
• Automated answer detection with 90-95% accuracy
• Batch processing capabilities for multiple sheets
• Modern desktop GUI with real-time processing
• Comprehensive reporting and statistics
• Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV)
• Error handling and quality assurance

🛠️ **Technical Stack:**
• Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
• Tkinter for desktop GUI
• Computer vision algorithms
• Image preprocessing and analysis
• Statistical analysis and reporting

📊 **What it does:**
- Reads scanned answer sheets
- Detects marked answers accurately
- Scores based on answer keys
- Generates detailed reports with confidence metrics
- Handles various image qualities and formats

💡 **Why I built this:**
Wanted to create a practical solution that combines computer vision, GUI development, and data processing. This project demonstrates my ability to build end-to-end systems that solve real-world problems.

### Week 2: Technical Deep Dive
```
🔍 Deep dive into the computer vision algorithms behind my OMR system!

The key challenge was accurately detecting marked answers across different image qualities. Here's how I solved it:

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Gaussian blur + adaptive thresholding
2. **Contour Detection**: Canny edge detection for bubble identification
3. **Fill Ratio Analysis**: Pixel density calculation for mark detection
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical analysis of detection quality

The result? 95% accuracy across various answer sheet formats!

### Week 3: Challenges and Solutions
```
💪 Building an OMR system wasn't easy! Here are the biggest challenges I faced:

❌ **Challenge 1**: Different answer sheet formats
✅ **Solution**: Flexible grid detection with configurable parameters

❌ **Challenge 2**: Varying image qualities
✅ **Solution**: Robust preprocessing pipeline with noise reduction

❌ **Challenge 3**: Multiple marks per question
✅ **Solution**: Confidence scoring and error flagging

The key lesson? Always plan for edge cases and build robust error handling from day one!
